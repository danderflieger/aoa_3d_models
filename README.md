# AoA 3D Models (Solidworks and 3mf files)
This is a repository for 3D printable parts (Solidworks parts &amp; assemblies as well as STL and 3MF files). You can edit the Solidworks files, if you like. And if you just want to print the parts, just load the STL/3MF files into your 3D Slicer software. I like Ultimaker Cura (https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura), but any slicer software that can interpret STL or 3MF files should work.

# Disclaimer:
By using this Angle of Attack Sensor (sensor) and/or Angle of Attack Indicator software (indicator), you agree with the following:
- you understand and agree that, while the sensor and indicator can contribute to better situational awareness in the cockpit, they are NOT designed or certified to be used as/by a primary flight instrument
- you understand and agree that the data produced by the sensor and/or the indicator will NOT be used as/by a primary flight instrument
- you understand and agree that the pilot in command is SOLELY responsible for the safe outcome of every flight
- the pilot in command accepts FULL responsibility for any accident, harm, death, and/or loss that occurs while using the sensor and/or indicator
- the pilot in command has briefed all passengers and all passengers agree to the same
- the pilot in command (and each passenger) agrees to NOT hold the designer and/or builder of the sensor and/or indicator responsible for any accident, harm, death and/or loss that occurs while using the sensor and/or indicator, unless the designer and/or builder is the designated pilot in command during the flight
